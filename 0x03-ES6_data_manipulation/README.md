# 0x03-ES6_data_manipulation

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to use map, filter and reduce on arrays
- Typed arrays
- The Set, Map, and Weak link data structures

- [0-get_list_students.js](0-get_list_students.js)
  - A function named getListStudents that returns an array of objects.

  - Each object should have three attributes: `id (Number)`, `firstName (String)`, and `location (String)`.

  - The array contains the following students in order:
  
    - Guillaume, id: 1, in San Francisco
    - James, id: 2, in Columbia
    - Serena, id: 5, in San Francisco
